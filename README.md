# What is it?
Small and simple C++ implementations for most of your coding problems that are asked in SDE I or II interviews at FAANGs that you will be able to implement on the spot if asked.

# What it supports?
## Data Structures
- Linked List as a class
- Queues as a class, Queue with `Max()` API
- Stacks as a class, Stack with `Max()` API
- Circular Queue
- Heaps as a class instead of the default `heapq` usage
- Trees and graphs as a class
- BiMap (Bi-directional Maps) Implementation, (HashMap implementation is not covered because on one will implement `dict = {}` if you can use it).
- Multi-threaded dictionary Implementation

# Algorithms
- BFS, DFS
- Few sorting algorithms
- Binary Search
- Djikstra, Bellman ford, floyd warshall algorithm
- In-order Pre-order, Post-order traversal of Binary trees
- Tree Satisfiability
    - Given Binary Tree is BST
    - Given Binary Tree is Max or MinHeap
    - Given Binary Tree is height-balanced
    - Given Binary Tree is symmetric
- Binary Tree Generation algorithm
- Few DP problems and a decorator for DP function call caching
